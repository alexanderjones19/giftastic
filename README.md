MMA giftastic is a fun and interactive gif displaying experience with the theme of Mixed Martial Arts. Buttons are displayed at the top of the page with the names of some of MMA's top fighters. When the user clicks these buttons the page is populated by gifs relating to the text of the button. There is also a feature for the user to add buttons of their own, so if the user doesn't like MMA they can add buttons relating to any topic they want. When the user fills out the form on the page and hits submit a new button will be added to the end of the other buttons on the page.

The app is made using HTML, the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework, JavaScript, and jQuery. The gifs are sourced from the giphy API.
